# Bonsai - Harp Library

Bonsai.Harp is the [Bonsai](https://bonsai-rx.org/) reference implementation of the [Harp](https://harp-tech.org/) protocol. It also provides shared core functionality for the high-level device interfaces in the [Harp ecosystem](https://github.com/harp-tech).

The Harp ecosystem allows extending experimental setup hardware functionality with integrated timestamp synchronisation across devices.

## How to install

Bonsai.Harp can be installed directly through the Bonsai package manager. In order to get editor and firmware update support, you should download both the `Bonsai.Harp` and `Bonsai.Harp.Design` packages.
